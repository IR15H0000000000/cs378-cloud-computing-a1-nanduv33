# Project Template

This is a Java Maven Project Template


# How to compile the project

We use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. 

You need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)  on your system. 

Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

# How to create a binary runnable package 


```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```


# How to run

```bash
mvn clean compile  exec:java -Dexec.args="taxi-data-sorted-large.csv.bz2 500000"
```



```bash
mvn clean compile  exec:java -Dexec.executable="edu.utexas.cs.cs378.Main" -DargLine="-Xmx2g" -Dexec.args="taxi-data-sorted-large.csv.bz2 1000000"
```


Input file is: 

taxi-data-sorted-large.csv.bz2 

Data line batch size is: 500000

You can modify the batch size based on available memory.


If you run this over SSH and it takes a lots of time you can run it in background using the following command

```bash
nohub mvn clean compile  exec:java -Dexec.executable="edu.utexas.cs.cs378.Main" -DargLine="-Xmx2g" -Dexec.args="taxi-data-sorted-large.csv.bz2  500000" 
```

We recommend the above command for running the Main Java executable. 


# Running with bash script (clean up leftover files before ran including previous result)

Give permissions to shell script if not already assigned

```bash
chmod u+x run.sh
```

# Run the script

```bash
./run.sh
```
